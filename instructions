directories:

	database: 	a) thermo.xml
				b) database.ipynb:
					the code that I wrote to build the database
				c) thermo.sqlite:
					the database that stores NASA polynomials for each specie


	input files: 	a) test1.xml
					b) rxns.xml:
						irreversible reactions
					c) rxns_reversible.xml:
						reversible reactions

	package:	a)chemkin.py:
					the original version from milestone1
				b)chemkin_2.py:
					Based on chemkin.py, I added some code to read in NASA polynomials for each specie from the database in the parse function.
					Still need to add reversible function.

	tests:	a)test_chemkin.ipynb
			b)test_chemkin.py




Files:
	
	Milestone1.md:	README.md from milestone1
	Milestone2.md:  Doc for milestone2

	script.py: 	just a script to test our module and can be ran to demo our project 

	setup.py:	needed to install PyPI? 

	thermo.py:	a class to compute backward reaction rate coefficient
				necessary for reversible reactions
				provided by Dr. Sondak, and needs to be modified to fit our current module
