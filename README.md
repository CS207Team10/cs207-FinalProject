## Introduction:

This program is a chemical kinetics library, which can be used to calculate reaction rate coefficients, progress rate and reaction rate for a given system of chemical reactions. Our code is able to compute 3 different kinds of reaction rate coefficients: Constant reaction rate coefficients, Arrhenius reaction rate coefficients and Modified Arrhenius reaction rate coefficients as specified below.

Each variable stands for A: Arrhenius prefactor, b: Modified Arrhenius parameter, E: Activation Energy, T: Temperature, and R: Ideal gas constant.

Progress rates and reaction rates of elementary reactions and irreversible reactions can also be handled by this program. 


A parse function is also included in our program, which was designed to parse an XML input file provided by users. The function handles the inputs by reading in all the needed data and store them for later calculation.


## Installation:

All the classes and functions necessary to run the library were stored in chemkin.py. All the tests were stored in test_chemkin.py. Both files can be downloaded from our repository, or you can obtain them here
[chemkin.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CS207Team10/cs207-FinalProject/master/chemkin.py), [test_chemkin.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CS207Team10/cs207-FinalProject/master/test_chemkin.py).

To use our program as library, move the two files into the same directory as your module, and
```python
import chemkin.py 
```
To run our test program, 
```
runÂ pytest --cov test_chemkin.py
```

## Basic Usage and Examples: 

Our program includes three separate classes: `ChemUtil`, `Reaction` and `ReactionSystem`. 

### `ChemUtil`

`ChemUtil` is an util class that contains all necessary functions to compute the coefficients and rates. It includes functions: `k_const`, `k_arr`, `k_mod_arr`, `progress_rate`, `reaction_rate` and `parse`. 

### `Reaction`:

`Reaction` is a class that can be used to create a Reaction object. It includes functions: `updateCoeff` and `updateReaction`.

### `ReactionSystem`:

`ReactionSystem` is a class that represents a ReactionSystem object. It includes functions: `buildFromList`, `buildFromXml`, `getProgressRate` and `getReactionRate`.

A sample workflow starts form initializing a `ReactionSystem` object. We need to set up all the needed variables: `T` (temperature), `R` (universal gas constant) and `concs`, which is the concentrations of each species (the order shoulbe be same with one in the input file):
```
import numpy as np
import chemkin as ck
T = 1500
R = 8.314
concs = np.array([2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0])
rsystem = ck.ReactionSystem(T, R, concs)
```

Then, we feed an input `.xml` file (see [here] for the format) to the system by calling `buildFromXml` function:
```
rsystem.buildFromXml("test1.xml")
```

We then can easily retrieve the progress rate and reaction rate by:
```
rsystem.getProgressRate()
rsystem.getReactionRate()
```
